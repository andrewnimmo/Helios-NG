@ARM Assembler notes
-------------------

Paul Beskeen
Dec 1991


Compatibility:
--------------

Other than the special cases descibed below, this assembler implements the
Helios generic assembler format and the ARM (VL860CXXX) assembler
syntax as defined in the 'ARM DATA MANUAL' (ISBN 0-13-781618). The additional
ARM3 (VL860C020) SWP instruction and the co-processor instructions are also
implemented.

The main incompatibilities with other ARM assemblers is that the Helios-ARM
assembler supports the standard Helios assembler directives, it produces
Helios GHOF object files and is required to produce PC relative code.
The first incompatibility means any use of assembler directives may have to be
changed in order to port ARM assembler code from older assemblers, the second
means that directives that require relocation support can not be implemented,
the later incompatibility means that any label or constant used in an address
situation will be taken as a PC relative value.

Be aware that code such as:
	ldr	r0, (pc, 4)
will produce object code of
	ldr	r0, (pc, -4)
As the generic assembler tries to automatically adjust for the pipeline.
Use of the LEA directive avoids this problem.

For compatibility with other ARM assemblers the line comment character ';'
can be used in addition to the generic '//' version.

For compatibility with AMPP '(' and ')' (rounded) brackets can be used
instead of '[' and ']' (square) brackets. All code that is to be passed
through AMPP will need to use rounded rather than square brackets.

For compatibility with older ARM assemblers, the '#' numeric constant prefix
may optionally be included. For example, the following source lines are
equivalent:
	cmp	r3, 23
	cmp	r3, #23

Note that '&' does not prefix hex (use 0x), but is used in constant
expressions as the bitwise AND.

Some ARM assemblers require a ',' (comma) between the last data processing
opcode and any shift specification. This is not required.
	e.g.
		// old format
		add	r1, r2, r3 , lsl 4

		// new format      ^
		add	r1, r2, r3 lsl 4

*NOTE* we ought to make this optional syntax! - At the moment we force the
user to remove it from any old source code.

Register aliases that are allowed are as follows:

FIRQ aliases:
	r8_fiq = 	r8
	r9_fiq = 	r9
	r10_fiq = 	r10
	r11_fiq = 	r11
	r12_fiq = 	r12
	r13_fiq = 	r13
	r14_fiq = 	r14
	r15_fiq = 	r15

IRQ aliases:
	r13_irq = 	r13
	r14_irq = 	r14
	r15_irq = 	r15

SVC aliases:
	r13_svc = 	r13
	r14_svc = 	r14
	r15_svc = 	r15

STD aliases:
	sp = 		r13
	lr = 		r14
	lk = 		r14
	pc = 		r15
	psr = 		r15

PCS aliases:
	a1-a4 =		r0-r3
	v1-v5 =		r4-r8
	mt/dp = 	r9
	use/sl =	r10
	fp =		r11
	tmp/ip =	r12
	usp = 		r13


Coprocessor register names are cr0-15.


Please note that the Generic Helios Object Format (GHOF) to which this
assembler is targeted, only supports position independent addressing. Therefore
any code that uses labels in an absolute fashion will not work as expected.

e.g.
	mov	r1, jumptab	// this will load the pc relative value of
				// jumptab from this position (r1 = 4).
				// NOT the absolute address of jumptab.
  jumptab:
	word	dothis
	word	dothat

or:
	bl	0x100		// branch forward by 0x100 bytes from here
				// NOT to address 0x100.


All uses of labels and constants for single data transfer intructions (LDR and
STR) result in correctly adjusted PC relative loads and stores. For example,
the following code loads a value from the address 'First' and stores it at
address 'Last'.


	ldr	r0, First
	str	r0, Last
	b	End

First:
	int	1

Last:
	int	0



NOP Pseudo Opcode
-----------------

	The only safe no-operation code is 'mov r0, r0' as a condition code
	op 'nv' (never) may be used in future processors as another opcode
	to extend the instruction set as space is limited. The "nop" pseudo
	-opcode does precisely that.

	@@@@@@ The assembler should raise a warning if the 'nv' condition is
	used.

		e.g.
			nop	// do nothing.


LEA Pseudo Opcode
-----------------

	lea[cc]	reg, constexpr

The arm assembler supports a load effective address opcode. This opcode
can be used to compute the absolute address of a label at run time. It
does this by adding or subtracting the relative address (given by the constexpr)
from the pc, storing the result in the destination register (reg). If the
relative address cannot be synthesised into an eight bit field plus rotate, then
an addressibility error is generated.

	e.g.
			import	.printf


			Function HelloWorld

			stmfd	sp!, {lr}	-- save link reg

			lea	r1, message	-- get address of message to
			bl	.printf		-- print and print it
			
			ldmfd	sp!, {pc}	-- return to caller

		message:
			char	"Hello World", 0



ARM SPECIFIC PATCHES:
---------------------

patcharmdt, patcharmdp, patcharmjp, patcharmdplsb, patcharmdpmid and
patcharmdprest.

Descriptions from linker doc required.



TODO:
-----

Update the porting guide in line with experiences porting the assembler to
the ARM.

Add ARM6 compatibility:
	mrs/msr opcodes
	arm6 regs = cpsr, spsr_mode, etc
	Errors for use of 'p' in ALU ops?

FPU mnemonics (still need hobjasm for fplib/fpdirect.a)

Add ANSI CPP compatible front-end:
	+ User familiarity
	+ Share headers with C.
	+ Could still use AMPP if required.

Or, Add genhdr converter to translate C header files into AMPP.

Make only 'export'ed labels global, not all labels.
Should 'import' also ref the label? Note that codestubs for the ARM still
need to be added to the linker. When they are, the assembler should be
upgraded (pass2_ARM.c COM_PCREL_24) to use them instead of labelrefs.

If value given to mov is negative, then the mvn opcode should be substituted
for mov (pag 2-72 arm data manual).
	- -ve mov to mvn, +ve mvn to mov substitution.
	- -ve and <-> bic +ve : pg 2-57 
	= -ve add <-> +ve SUB : pg 2-56

Add HS higher than or same (== CS) & LO lower than (== CC)
	condition codes mnemonics.

Maybe theres a better way to handle all the conditionals?

Extend the lea pseudo-opcode to the assembler.
	LEA/LEAL/LDCON pseudo-opcodes for long range targets and
	large constants.
	- use VLSI ADR/ADRL mnemonics instead of LEA?
	- see comments and code in armconst.c

does patchintr(patcharmjp, labelref(.fred), b 0) adjust for the
pipeline correctly?

does patcharmdprest work correctly (ref posixasm.a)

Whenever code is produced, we ought to check that it is word aligned!

Add better error reporting to the assembler:

	Go through the different warnings described in the RISC OS programmers
	manual volume VI appendix B.

	Warnings for:
		Shifts of 0
		If nv condition used (should use NOP).
