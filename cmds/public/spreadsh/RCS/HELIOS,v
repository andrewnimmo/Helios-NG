@This has been hacked to work under Helios as a nice demo program.
The cursor movement keys have been disabled as sc does not recognise
the Helios CSI x9b and hence the keys are useless.  If someone
does fix that up, then they should remove the SIMPLE definition
wfrom the makefile and replace with BSD43.
