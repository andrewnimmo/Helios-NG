\begin{man}
  \PP Generate a superblock.
  \FO {\tt mksuper <PathToVolume>}
  \DE This command works with structured volumes only.
             A superblock (info block 0) of the specified volume is constructed
             depending on the \HEDI\ information and written to
             disc.
             The volume has to be loaded with the {\tt -m} option, otherwise
             mksuper will return an error.
             This command should only be used if the checker failed because of
             a corrupted superblock.
  \SA {\tt format}, {\tt load}, {\tt makefs}
