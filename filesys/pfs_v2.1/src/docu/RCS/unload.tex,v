\begin{man}
  \PP Unload a volume.
  \FO {\tt unload [-v] <PathToVolume>}
  \DE The volume specified by {\tt <PathToVolume>} is unloaded
             (unmounted). Actually working processes on that volume are closed
             and the volume is updated. Protected media are unlocked so that
             they can be removed. In contrary to the {\tt termvol} command the
             central server for this volume is not terminated so that the 
             volume may be loaded again.

             Option:

             \begin{itemize}
             \item {\tt -v}\newline
               {\tt unload} waits for the completion of the volume unloading.
             \end{itemize}

  \SA {\tt fs}, {\tt load}, {\tt termvol}
