  \PP Generates a ``SCSI-information file''.
  \FO {\tt gsi <Input> <Output>}
  \DE {\tt gsi} is a simple compiler which generates a binary object from the
             given SCSI-information {\tt <Input>} file. The file name which is
             searched by the MSC device driver is \HESI,
             so {\tt gsi}'s {\tt <Output>} has to be that file.
