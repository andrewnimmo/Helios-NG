\begin{man}
  \PP Generate a ``device information file''.
  \FO {\tt gdi <Input> <Output>}
  \DE {\tt gdi} is a simple compiler which generates a binary object from the
             given device information {\tt <Input>} file. The default filename which
             is searched by the server is \HEDI, so {\tt gdi}'s
             {\tt <Output>} should be that file. When using other values for
             {\tt <Output>} (necessary if you are using several MSCs with different
             \DI s), the file server has to be given the correct \DI\ as
             parameter.
