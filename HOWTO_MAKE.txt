This is the (yet) lame Howto on building Helios-NG

For more information see:

--- snip ---

1.) Edit the 'makeinc/makesun4' file to suit your pathes.
    e.g. for historical reasons, Helios-NG was put into the same
    directory structure as back-then: 
     /giga/HeliosRoot/Helios
    You can change this of course.

2.) Call 'make ./makeinc/makesun4' from the source root-folder
    to set neccessary variables.

3.) Lean back, cross fingers, drink tee/coffe/whatever...
