
How to make the Helios Server (in DOS)

This initial version needs a Microsoft C Compiler, preferably V7.00.
The last MS-C version able to compile DOS programs was VC++ 1.5x.

You will also need a Microsoft Assembler (MASM). Good results were achived with V6.11.

To compile the Helios Server change into the Server root directory (which contains this file).
Then call MS Make by entering:

	nmake /f ibm/makefile.pc
	
If everything works fine this should give you some warnings (ignore them) and a "server.exe" in the Server root directory.

Some insights:

The Helios Server (mind the capital "S") source offers several 'surprises' for the average C coder... 

1) Heavy use of Coroutienes. In a sentence that's multithreading for the poor.
   (See wikipedia for more insights)
2) Frequent use of funciton pointers.
and last but not least
3) Strange re-#defines of standard C calls because the author came from BCPL and hated C.

I'll try to document most of it at my page http://www.geekdot.com/category/helios/helios-ng/
