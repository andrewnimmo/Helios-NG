@			Keyboard Server
			===============

   This directory contains sources for the /keyboard server described in
"The Helios Parallel Operating System". These sources are completely
untested, and are supplied with no guarantees as to their functionality.
The /keyboard server has been extracted from a much larger and more
complicated server, which is not publicly available. The device drivers
have been invented and will not work with any existing hardware.

The directory contains the following files:

  keyboard.c : the sources of the /keyboard server as described in the
	book. These sources have been modified somewhat to cope with
	errors generated by the device driver.

  keyboard.h : a header file defining the KeyboardDCB structure.

  linkdev.c  : a pseudo device driver which gets keyboard data from a
	dumb link

  eventdev.c : another pseudo device driver which uses the transputer's
	event mechanism

  device.a   : an ampp source file needed to build the device drivers.
	This file can be used as a basis for users' own device drivers.

  modend.a   : another ampp source file

  makefile   : to build the /keyboard server and the device drivers.
