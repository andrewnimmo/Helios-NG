@# Host.con file for the TDMB409 board
# For more information read the comments below the line of dashes.
# For a quick start just edit the three lines below so that they
# have the correct values.  (Everything from a hash to the end of the
# line is a comment).

link_base         = 0x150	# 0x150, 0x200, 0x300
tdmb40x_fifo_base = 0xC00000	# 0xC00000, 0xC80000, 0xD00000
helios_directory  = \helios	# where you installed Helios

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is a configuration file for the MS-DOS and MS-WINDOWS
# versions of the Helios-C40 I/O server program.  It has been set
# up to drive a
#
#	     Transtech TDMB409 board
#
# Before you can use this file you should read the notes below, and also
# the information in the Helios-C40 Installation Guide.  If you do not
# have a Transtech TDMB409 board, but some other kind of C40 board
# then you should not use this file.  Check the Helios Installation
# Guide for the file you should be using. 
#
# All lines that start with a hash ( # ) is a comment which is ignored
# by the I/O server.  Lines that do not start with a hash are
# instructions to the I/O server telling it how to behave or telling it
# about the C40 board that it is trying to drive. 
#
# In order to use this file you must do the following ...
#
#   1) Rename this file to HOST.CON
#
#   2) Read the notes below (up to, but not beyond the line of
#      asterisks) and ensure that the entries mentioned in those notes
#      have the correct values for your configuration.
#
#   3) Start Helios by running the server program (server.exe for
#      MS-DOS or winsrvr.exe for MS-WINDOWS).
#
#   4) If Helios boots up then tell all your friends, throw a party
#      and generally have a good time.
#      If Helios does not start, then check this file, reread the
#      installation notes (especially the trouble shooting section),
#      and if all else fails, contact DSL.
#
# The configuraton options at the start of this file must be set up to
# match your system.  The following paragraphs describe those options.
#
# The link_base entry specifies where the link used to communicate
# with the C40 appears in the PC's memory map.  This is set by the
# jumpers JP1 and JP2 on the TDMB409 board.
#
# The tdmb40x_fifo_base entry specifies where the TDMB409's fast FIFO
# interface appears in the PC's memory map.  This is set by the jumpers
# JP3 and JP4 on the TDMB409 board.
#
# You should check to make sure that the values of these options agrees
# with the values set by the jumpers.  You may have to change the
# jumper settings if you discover that the address clashes with some
# other board that you have installed in your PC.
#
# Note: Not all PCs are capable of supporting the FIFO interface.  If
# you are unable to boot the TDMB409 board using any of the FIFO base
# settings then you will have to revert to using the slower TIM40
# interface.  To do this change the line reading "box = TDMB409" in the
# Fixed Section below to read "box = TIM40".  Helios will still work, it
# will just have a slower interface to the PC.
#
# The helios_directory entry tells the I/O server where Helios has
# been installed on your hard disk.  If you used the default options
# of the install program on the distribution disks (ie you ran
# a:install a: or b:install b: ), then your copy of Helios will have
# been placed in c:\helios, and you will not need to change the entry.
# If however you decided to install Helios somewhere else on your hard
# disk, then you must change the entry to reflect this.  For example, if
# you installed Helios into d:\helios then you should change the line to
# read "helios_directory = d:\helios".
#
# That's it.  Now save the changes you have made to this file, (if
# any), and try starting Helios.
#

# **************************************************************************
#
#               Customisation Section
#
# If you are installing Helios for the first time you should not need
# to alter any of the entries in this section.  Once you have a
# working Helios system, however, you may find that you want to change
# some of these entries in order to improve Helios' performance.
# These entries are documented in the template.con file and in "The
# Helios Parallel Operating System" book, section 8.4.3

# c40_load_nucleus_global_s1	# /

# ************************************************************************
#
# 		Fixed Section
#
# You should not need to modify any of the following entries. They are
# here in order to make the TDMB409 board work.  If you really want to
# customise your installation then you should use the template.con
# file.  Edit the template.con file to contain the same values as are
# currently set up in this file, then copy the template.con file to
# host.con, and carry on from there.

# Helios can still configure itself to the target system.

				# (reset config line and swap out true IDROM)

# items specify the contents of the IDROM to send. The default IDROM values
