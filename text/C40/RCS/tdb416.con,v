@# Host.con file for TDB416 board
#
# For more information read the comments below the line of dashes.
# For a quick start just edit the two lines below so that they
# have the correct values.  (Everything from a hash to the end of the
# line is a comment).

link_base        = 0x300	# set to 0x200 or 0x300
helios_directory = \helios	# where you installed Helios

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is a configuration file for the MS-DOS and MS-WINDOWS
# versions of the Helios-C40 I/O server program.  It has been set
# up to drive a
#
#	     Transtech TDB416 C40 board
#
# Before you can use this file you should read the notes below, and also
# the information in the Helios-C40 Installation Guide.  If you do not
# have a Transtech TDB416 board, but some other kind of C40 board then
# you should not use this file.  Check the Helios Installation Guide
# for the file you should be using. 
#
# All lines that start with a hash ( # ) is a comment which is ignored
# by the I/O server.  Lines that do not start with a hash are
# instructions to the I/O server telling it how to behave or telling it
# about the C40 board that it is trying to drive. 
#
# In order to use this file you must do the following ...
#
#   1) Rename this file to HOST.CON
#
#   2) Read the notes below (up to, but not beyond the line of
#      asterisks) and ensure that the entries mentioned in those notes
#      have the correct values for your configuration.
#
#   3) Start Helios by running the server program (server.exe for
#      MS-DOS or winsrvr.exe for MS-WINDOWS).
#
#   4) If Helios boots up then tell all your friends, throw a party
#      and generally have a good time.
#      If Helios does not start, then check this file, reread the
#      installation notes (especially the trouble shooting section),
#      and if all else fails, contact DSL.
#
# The configuraton options at the start of this file must be set up to
# match your system.  The following paragraphs describe those options.
#
# The link_base entry specifies where the link used to communicate
# with the C40 appears in the PC's memory map.  This is set by
# switches 1 to 4 of the TSW1 bank of switches.  (See page 13 of the
# Transtech TDB416 User Manual).  You should check to make sure that
# the value here agrees with the value set by these jumpers.  You may
# have to change the switch settings on the TDB416 board if you find
# that it clashes with some other board installed in your PC.  The most
# likely values for this entry are 0x200 or 0x300, although it can take
# values in the range 0x000 to 0x3c0.
#
# The helios_directory entry tells the I/O server where Helios has
# been installed on your hard disk.  If you used the default options
# of the install program on the distribution disks (ie you ran
# a:install a: or b:install b: ), then your copy of Helios will have
# been placed in c:\helios, and you will not need to change the entry.
# If however you decided to install Helios somewhere else on your hard
# disk, then you must change the entry to reflect this.  For example, if
# you installed Helios into d:\helios then you should change the line to
# read "helios_directory = d:\helios".
#
# That's it.  Now save the changes you have made to this file, (if
# any), and try starting Helios.
#

# **************************************************************************
#
#               Customisation Section
#
# If you are installing Helios for the first time you should not need
# to alter any of the entries in this section.  Once you have a
# working Helios system, however, you may find that you want to change
# some of these entries in order to improve Helios' performance.
# These entries are documented in the template.con file and in "The
# Helios Parallel Operating System" book, section 8.4.3

#ethernet			# Enable Ethernet support
#Unix_fileio			# Enable Unix like file I/O
server_windows_nopop		# Don't pop up the windows for system messages

#
# 		Fixed Section
#
# You should not need to modify any of the following entries. They are
# here in order to make the TDB416 board work.  If you really want to
# customise your installation then you should use the template.con
# file.  Edit the template.con file to contain the same values as are
# currently set up in this file, then copy the template.con file to
# host.con, and carry on from there.

# ================================

# Simple setting of the target processors memory size. This item only defines
# local bus strobe 0, with an assumed address base of 0x300000. Can be used for
# quick configuration of expandable memory boards such as the TDB416.
# processor_memory = 0x400000   # 4Mb

# c40_disable_cache             # Disable the C40's cache. This should be
				# disabled Hema DSP1 with TMX rev 'C40's.

# c40_disable_halfduplex        # Disable halfduplex protocol on link comms.
                                # Should be disabled for Hema DSP1.


# IDROM configuration.
#
# The TIM-40 specification defines a standard format ROM that contains
# data that characterises a C40 system. Helios uses this to automatically
# configure itself to the target system. If your C40 board doesn't implement
# an IDROM, don't despair, the I/O Server can send a pseudo IDROM so that
# Helios can configure itself to the target system.

# c40_use_pseudo_idrom          # Download and use the following IDROM.
                                # If target system doesn't implement an IDROM.

# c40_replace_idrom             # Download and use the following IDROM.
                                # But still go through IDROM setup sequence
                                # (reset config line and swap out true IDROM).

# If either of the above two options are set then the following configuration
# items specify the contents of the IDROM to send. The default IDROM values
# are shown in brackets. These are used if you dont give a new value.

# c40_idrom_cpu_id =    # (0) CPU type (00 = C40).
