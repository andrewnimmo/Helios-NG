@# Host.con file for the LSI QPC/C40 version 1 board
#
# For more information read the comments below the line of dashes.
# For a quick start just edit the three lines below so that they
# have the correct values.  (Everything from a hash to the end of the
# line is a comment).

link_base        = 0x300        # set in range 0x020 to 0xFE0
qpc_slabase      = 0x280	# set in range 0x100 to 0x300
helios_directory = \helios	# where you installed Helios

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is a configuration file for the MS-DOS and MS-WINDOWS
# versions of the Helios-C40 I/O server program.  It has been set
# up to drive a
#
#     LSI QPC/C40 version 1 Motherboard with a single TIM in the first slot
#
# Before you can use this file you should read the notes below, and also
# the information in the Helios-C40 Installation Guide.  If you do not
# have a LSIQPC/C40 version 1 board, but some other kind of C40 board
# then you should not use this file.  Check the Helios Installation
# Guide for the file you should be using. 
#
# All lines that start with a hash ( # ) is a comment which is ignored
# by the I/O server.  Lines that do not start with a hash are
# instructions to the I/O server telling it how to behave or telling it
# about the C40 board that it is trying to drive. 
#
# In order to use this file you must do the following ...
#
#   1) Rename this file to HOST.CON
#
#   2) Read the notes below (up to, but not beyond the line of
#      asterisks) and ensure that the entries mentioned in those notes
#      have the correct values for your configuration.
#
#   3) Start Helios by running the server program (server.exe for
#      MS-DOS or winsrvr.exe for MS-WINDOWS).
#
#   4) If Helios boots up then tell all your friends, throw a party
#      and generally have a good time.
#      If Helios does not start, then check this file, reread the
#      installation notes (especially the trouble shooting section),
#      and if all else fails, contact DSL.
#
# The configuraton options at the start of this file must be set up to
# match your system.  The following paragraphs describe those options.
#
# The link_base entry specifies where the control block used to drive
# the QPC board appears in the PC's memory map.  (This is refered to as
# the HIOBASE in the LSI documentation).  This is set by the LK1
# jumpers on the board.  You should check to make sure that the value
# here agrees with the value set by these jumpers.  You may have to
# change the jumper settings on the QPC board if you find that it
# clashes with some other board installed in your PC. 
#
# The qpc_slabase entry specifies where the communication link with
# the C40 should appear in the PC's memory map.  The address of this
# link is controlled by software, (not jumpers on the QPC board), so you
# can choose almost any address.  You should be careful, however, to
# make sure that you choose an address that does not classh with any
# hardware that you have installed in your PC.
#
# The helios_directory entry tells the I/O server where Helios has
# been installed on your hard disk.  If you used the default options
# of the install program on the distribution disks (ie you ran
# a:install a: or b: install b:), then your copy of Helios will have
# been placed in c:\helios, and you will not need to change this
# entry.  If however you decided to install Helios somewhere else on
# your hard disk, then you must change the entry to reflect this.
# For example, if you installed Helios into d:\helios then you should
# change the line to read "helios_directory = d:\helios". 
#
# That's it.  Now save the changes you have made to this file, (if
# any), and try starting Helios.
#

# **************************************************************************
#
#               Customisation Section
#
# If you are installing Helios for the first time you should not need
# to alter any of the entries in this section.  Once you have a
# working Helios system, however, you may find that you want to change
# some of these entries in order to improve Helios' performance.
# These entries are documented in the template.con file and in "The
# Helios Parallel Operating System" book, section 8.4.3

#ethernet			# Enable Ethernet support
#Unix_fileio			# Enable Unix like file I/O
# c40_load_nucleus_local_s0	# \
# c40_load_nucleus_local_s1	#  \ where to load the Helios nucleus
c40_load_nucleus_global_s0	#  / set EXACTLY ONE of these
# c40_load_nucleus_global_s1	# /
server_windows_nopop		# Don't pop up the windows for system messages
message_limit       = 64000	# Reduce this if PC is running out of memory
# coroutine_stack   = 1500 	# Uncomment if the PC is running out of memory
floppies            = ab    	# Floppy disk drives available on the PC
logfile             = logbook	# Name of error log file
logging_destination = screen	# Where to send errors: screen, file, both


# ************************************************************************
#
# 		Fixed Section
#
# You should not need to modify any of the following entries. They are
# here in order to make the board work.  If you really want to
# customise your installation then you should use the template.con
# file.  Edit the template.con file to contain the same values as are
# currently set up in this file, then copy the template.con file to
# host.con, and carry on from there.
