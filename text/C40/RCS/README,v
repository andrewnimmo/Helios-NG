@		     Resource  Maps
		     --------  ----

The directory "hepc" in "/helios/etc" contains an example resource map for 
a two processor system.  This resource map is supplied in both textual
form (hepc.rm) and compiled (binary) form (hepc.map).  If you want to
try using the resource map, then follow these steps:

	1. Copy the resource map (text and binary) into the 
	   "/helios/etc" directory.

	2. Edit the "initrc" file in the "/helios/etc" directory.

	   a. Remove the hash from the start of the following lines,
	      (which form Option 1):

		#run -e /helios/bin/startns startns -r
		#waitfor /sm
		#console /window console
		#run -e /helios/bin/newuser newuser
	
	b. Put a hash at the start of the following lines, (which
	   form Option 2):

		console /window console
		run -e /helios/bin/login login

	c. Append the name of the (compiled) resource map to the line 
	   starting the Network server.  ie change the line
 
		run -e /helios/bin/startns startns -r

	   to read

		run -e /helios/bin/startns startns -r hepc.map

	d. Start Helios, (or re-start Helios if you were already
	   running it).
