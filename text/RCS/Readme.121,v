The version of Helios in this directory was last frozen at Helios_1_2_1 on
Tuesday 2nd April 1991.

To build a working Helios 1.2.1, the following steps are required:

	1. change directory to makeinc
	2. modify your oem makescript (e.g. makeparsytec for Parsytec,
	   maketelmat for Telmat, etc.) as follows:

		a. change HHOST to the host machine on which the port
		   is taking place. Currently supported hosts are:

			SUN4 - to build Helios on SUN4 machines.
			HELIOSTRAN - to build Helios under Helios.

		b. change hsrc to the root directory of your Helios source
		   tree.

		c. change HPROD to the root directory for Helios binaries

		d. change HHOSTBIN to the bin directory for compilation tools.
		   These are cc, asm, ampp, etc. If your source licence allows,
		   these tools will be built first to ensure that the new
		   version of Helios is built using the latest versions.

	3. change directory to $(HSRC)
	4. run your makescript with the install option
		e.g. makeparsytec install, or
		     maketelmat install.
	5. The whole Helios world should now build itself !!

*** Warning ***

	The Helios make system assumes that you are using GNU make !!!


Helios 1.2.1
------------

Helios 1.2.1 is intended as a patch to Helios 1.2 as originally distributed.
The following files are being distributed by DSL for 1.2.1:

	nucleus, tfm, netagent, netserv, session, rboot, pa_rboot, 
	login, shell, more, gdi, c, test, kill,
	Posix and BSD libraries,
	I/O server,
	include files.

The kill command is new and allows users to kill (and send signals to)
processes by name e.g.

	kill tla
	kill shell.11
	kill -HUP fs

kill -l gives a complete list of signals.

Please note that your source distribution may contain commands not issued as
part of Helios 1.2 or Helios 1.2.1 (e.g the curses/termcap libraries).
These programs are, of course, not documented or fully tested. They
are provided for your own internal use and will probably appear in a future
release of Helios.

The complete list of binaries for a Helios release is found in the file
$(HSRC)/Files. On SUN4 machines, a list of the binaries can be obtained by
running your makescript with the options OPTS=PC List.

Note also that the Public Domain software has only been added recently to the
Helios source directory and the Helios 1.2 binary release disc should still be
used for these products.
