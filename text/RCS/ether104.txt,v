@Ethernet I V1.04
================

The Ethernet I V1.04 package features the following modifications :

1. inet daemon (/helios/lib/inetd)
   - Invoking the inet daemon with the -l option causes service requests to be
     syslogged and appended to the file /helios/etc/inetd.log. Requests are 
     logged in the following form :
     DD.MM.YY HH:MM:SS Host <IP address> requests <service>

2. rsh daemon (/helios/lib/rshd)
   - Invoking remote shells on Helios machines does not leave rshd 'zombies'
     running.

3. ftp daemon (/helios/lib/ftpd)
   - The ftp daemon does not generate fcntl error messages when it is invoked.
   
4. rcp program (/helios/bin/rcp)
   - Existing files are truncated before being overwritten.

5. tcpip server (/helios/lib/tcpip)
   - 'ls /internet' does not generate statistical information.
   
6. termcap database (/helios/etc/termcap)
   - Addition of helios ansi window. When a remote login is requested from a
     Helios machine, the tty server looks for an 'ansi' entry in termcap. The 
     entry that has been provided sets various PC-specific terminal attributes
     (for example, PageUp and PageDown are defined to be window 'hot keys' and
     can be used to switch between remote shell windows).
   - Note: Xterminals
     The termcap database includes an Xterminal entry (xterm). It is not 
     necessary to explicitly set the terminal type if using xterm version 1.3
     or later. Users of earlier versions should add the following to their 
     cshrc scripts :
       if $?WINDOWID then
         setterm xterm
       endif

7. INMOS IMSB431 device driver (/helios/lib/in-ether.d)
   - No longer generates statistical output.

8. Addition of CORAL HPT02 Device Driver
   - The CORAL HPT02 Ethernet TRAM device driver (hpt02.dev) has been installed
     in /helios/lib. Please refer to the supplementary note entitled 
     "CORAL/Helios Ethernet Support Distribution Notes" for details pertaining 
     to the configuration and use of this driver.

9. Optimizations
   - Some optimization has been applied to the system software. As a result, a
     small improvement in performance can be expected.
