-- Description:
--
-- ROMed copy of IDROM structure.
--
-- The following data defines the boards 'IDROM' structure. The IDROM
-- is a standard defined by Texas Instruments and used by Helios-C40 to 
-- adapt to the environment in which it find itself running. The
-- document "TIM-40 TMS320C4x Module Specification" defines the
-- standard and is available from TI. For a quick description of the
-- following items, refer to the Helios example I/O Server configuration
-- file "template.con" on the Helios-C40 distribution disk/tape. Its
-- structure is also defined in "/hsrc/include/ampp/tim40.m".
--
-- This information was originally placed in c40rombt.a, but for easier
-- modification by users has been removed, and replaced by an include
-- statement

BoardIDROM:
	-- Miscellaneous items. The following 7 items do not need to be set
	-- as they are not used by Helios.
	word	IDROM.sizeof / 4	-- SIZE - defined in words.
	short	0xfffe		-- MAN_ID - manufacturers ID.
	byte	0		-- CPU_ID (0 = C40).
	byte	49		-- CPU_CLK (49 = 40Mhz, 39 = 50Mhz, 29 = 60Mhz)
	short	0		-- MODEL_NO - board type ID/
	byte	0		-- REV_LVL - board revison level.
	byte	0		-- RESERVED.

	-- Memory bank location and size. These values must be set for your
	-- board. The following example contents define 2 blocks of memory,
	-- local strobe 0 and global strobe 0, starting at addresses 0x300000
	-- and 0x80000000 respectively, both blocks containing 4MB's of RAM.
	-- ONLY RAM memory should be included in these descriptions, NOT ROM
	-- Helios initialises its memory pool bounds from these values.
	word	0x80000000	-- GBASE0.
	word	-1		-- GBASE1 (-1 = no memory).
	word	0x00300000	-- LBASE0.
	word	-1		-- LBASE1 (-1 = no memory).

	-- The following memory bank sizes are defined in terms of number of
	-- words, NOT bytes.
	word	0x00100000	-- GSIZE0 (4MB's).
	word	0		-- GSIZE1.
	word	0x00100000	-- LSIZE0 (4MB's).
	word	0		-- LSIZE1.

	word	0800		-- FSIZE (just onchip RAM).

	-- Speed of memory - not used by Helios.
	byte	0x22		-- WAIT_G.
	byte	0x22		-- WAIT_L.
	byte	0x55		-- PWAIT_G.
	byte	0x55		-- PWAIT_L.

	-- Timer values - TIMER0_PERIOD must be set for accurate Helios clock.
	word	0x2710		-- TIMER0_PERIOD (40Mhz 0x2710, 50Mhz 0x30d4).
	word	0x80		-- TIMER1_PERIOD (DRAM refresh frequency).
	short	0x2c2		-- TIMER0_CTRL.
	short	0		-- TIMER1_CTRL (Can be used for DRAM refresh).

	-- Memory control registers - These are actually set by the CPU
	-- boot loader header.
	word	0x3e39fff0	-- GBCR.
	word	0x3e39fff0	-- LBCR.

	-- Not used by Helios.
	word	1		-- AINIT_SIZE.
