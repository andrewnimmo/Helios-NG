# The form for each entry is:
# <internet address>	<official hostname> <aliases>
#
# For example:
# 192.1.2.34	hpfcrm	loghost
#
# See the hosts(4) manual page for more information.
# Note: The entries cannot be preceded by a space.
#	The format described in this file is the correct format.
#       The original Berkeley manual page contains an error in
#	the format description.
