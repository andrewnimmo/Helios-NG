laserp, laserpri (Unsupported software)

Purpose : HP LaserJet filter

Format : laserp [-l] [-t] [-w] [-2] [-u] [[name] ...]

Description :
laserpri is an HP LaserJet filter program. The shell script, laserp, simply 
pipes the output of laserpri to lpr, i.e.
	/helios/local/bin/laserpri $* | /helios/bin/lpr -l
The program will obviously only be of immediate use to sites that have access
an HP LaserJet.

Arguments :
-l		suppress line numbers
-t		suppress title
-w		print sideways
-2		print sideways in 2 columns
-u		display usage
name ...	the name of the file to be printed. If not specified, the 
		standard input, terminated by EOF, is used

Installation :
'make install' moves laserpri and laserp to /helios/local/bin
