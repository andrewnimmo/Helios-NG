@# Helios Sample Printer Capability Database
# $Id: printcap,v 1.5 1992/02/25 17:40:57 craig Exp craig $
# The printer capability database need only specify:
# - the name of the remote machine 	:rm=<...>:
# - the names of the remote printers	:rp=<...>:
# - the local spool directories		:sd=<...>:
#
# There are a range of other printcap specifications that pertain directly to
# the remote host (e.g. :lp=<output device name>:,:br#<baud rate>:) - these
# should not be included here. In addition, local filter specifications (:cf,
# :df, :gf, :if, :nf, :of, :rf, :tf, :vf) are not supported - please refer to
# the Network Services Guide for information on the use of filters.
#
# This example assumes that the remote host, jabberwocky, has two printers
# named laserjet and qms. laserjet is defined to be the default printer (lp).
# The :lf entry identifies the error logging file (default is the controlling
# console).
