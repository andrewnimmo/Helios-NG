tinybiff (Unsupported software)

Purpose : Biff daemon

Format : /helios/local/lib/tinybiff &

Description :
tinybiff is a *highly* simplified biff daemon, intended only for use on 
single-user systems. The program simply waits for notification from 
/helios/bin/mail that mail has arrived, and then writes the name of the 
recipient and the time to the controlling console. tinybiff does not take any 
arguments.

Installation :
'make install' moves tinybiff to /helios/local/lib.
