@			Farm Library Examples
			=====================

  This directory contains a number of example programs illustrating
the use of the Farm library. 

1) pi is the basic example from the library documentation. It calculates
   an estimate for the value of pi by a simple integration.

2) pi2 is a slightly modified version of the previous example which
   uses the various speed-up options within the library to improve
   performance. In particular the source code is split into two
   modules, a main module and a calculation module, and the latter will
   be moved to fast on-chip memory.

3) pi3 also calculates pi but using a different algorithm, a Monte Carlo
   method. This algorithm is fault-tolerant and usually the calculation can
   continue in spite of the failure of one or more processors.

4) mandel is a standard Mandelbrot program which displays its graphics
   using an X server.
