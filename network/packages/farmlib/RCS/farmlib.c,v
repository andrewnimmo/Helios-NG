***	This is a very temporary state.
***

***  1) Is there a TFM ? If not, complain vociferously.
***  2) The taskforce template is allocated and the controller task is
***     initialised.
***  3) Next the taskforce is constructed. The flood option is rather
***	significant. Basically the main distribute function creates the
***	basis of the taskforce, containing just the controller, and then
***	calls one of the four distribute functions. These distribute
***	functions return NULL to indicate that no extra components were
***	added to the taskforce, or a suitable enlarged taskforce.
***	For the Fm_Network and Fm_Domain options the various tasks will have
***	been mapped onto obtained processors. For Fm_Fixed the processors
***	will be unmapped, allowing more than one worker to run on a given
***	processor. For Fm_Processors the supplied processors are used,
***	and hopefully these will have been obtained already.
***  4) Given this taskforce, RmConvertTaskToTaskforce() will do the
***     rest of the work. The remaining tricky bits are the responsibility
***	of the Resource Management library and the TFM.

*** The worker checks whether or not the controller still exists by a Helios
*** call rather than by invoking RmLib, to avoid excessive numbers of
*** connections to the TFM. If the controller is no longer accessible then
*** the worker exits.
