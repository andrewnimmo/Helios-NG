@Various files had been left checked out somehow, tidying up.

@/**
*** This file describes various changes needed to Helios, particularly
*** the header files.
***
*** Module table slots: the Resource Management library uses slot 24,
*** previously used by the Network Control library. Slot 23, previously
*** used by the support library, is now free again.

/**
*** codes.h
***
*** The subsystem SS_Login is redundant. SS_Batch is not needed for 1.2,
*** but will be reused for 1.3
***
*** I would like a new EG, EG_RmLib, for returning Resource Management
*** library errors.
***
*** Also new error objects, EO_Password etc.
***
*** All Charlie's private protocol codes for use with the TFM and
*** Network Server are redundant as far as I am concerned. I assume that
*** the nucleus does not use them.

*** FG_SendEnv
*** FG_Signal
*** FG_ProgramInfo
*** FG_RequestEnv

*** FG_NetMask
*** FG_NetStatus
*** FG_NetReq
